# Binary Trees

A comprehensive project focused on binary tree data structures and operations, completed as part of the Software Engineering curriculum at African Leadership Xcelerator. This project explores various concepts including binary tree traversal methods and different types of binary trees (complete, full, perfect, and balanced).

## Project Overview

Learn and implement fundamental binary tree operations including:
- Basic tree operations (creation, insertion, deletion)
- Tree traversal methods (pre-order, in-order, post-order, level-order)
- Different types of binary trees (BST, AVL, Max Heap)
- Tree properties and characteristics

## Technical Details

- Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Language: C
- Compiler: gcc 9.4.0
